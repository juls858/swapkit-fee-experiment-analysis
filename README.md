- 📋 **Phase 3**: Planned - Statistical analysis and elasticity modeling

## Overview

This project analyzes THORChain's fee experiment data to understand the impact of different fee tiers on swap volume, revenue, and user behavior. The analysis uses data from Snowflake's `9R.FEE_EXPERIMENT` schema and provides interactive visualizations through Streamlit dashboards.

### Key Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Robust Snowflake connection handling with multiple authentication methods
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of fee experiment metrics
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tools for elasticity modeling and hypothesis testing
- **High Performance**: Leverages Polars for efficient data processing
- **Modern Python**: Built with Python 3.13, PDM, and the Astral toolchain (Ruff, uv)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** (you have 3.12.8 ✅)
- **PDM** (Python Dependency Manager) - will install below
- **Snowflake account** with access to `9R.FEE_EXPERIMENT` schema

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Install PDM

PDM is not yet installed on your system. Choose one method:

**Option A: Using the official installer (recommended)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

**Option B: Using Homebrew (macOS)**
```bash
brew install pdm
```

**Option C: Using pip**
```bash
pip install --user pdm
```

After installation, verify it works:
```bash
pdm --version
# Should show: PDM, version 2.x.x
```

If `pdm` command is not found, add it to your PATH:
```bash
# For bash/zsh, add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Then reload your shell:
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 2. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to project directory (if not already there)
cd /path/to/swapkit-fee-experiment-analysis

# Install all dependencies (production + dev)
pdm install

# This will:
# - Create a virtual environment in .venv/
# - Install pandas, polars, streamlit, snowflake-snowpark-python, etc.
# - Install dev tools: pytest, ruff, pre-commit, jupyter
# - Take 2-5 minutes depending on your connection
```

#### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically format and lint your code before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks into git
pdm run precommit-install

# (Optional) Run hooks on all files to verify setup
pdm run precommit-run
```

#### 4. Configure Snowflake Connection

Choose **ONE** of these methods (in order of preference):

**Option A: Connection file** (recommended for local development)
```bash
# Create the Snowflake config directory
mkdir -p ~/.snowflake

# Create the connections file with your credentials
cat > ~/.snowflake/connections.toml << 'EOF'
[9R]
account = "your-account-identifier"
user = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "9R"
schema = "FEE_EXPERIMENT"
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
EOF

# Secure the file (only you can read it)
chmod 600 ~/.snowflake/connections.toml
```

Replace the placeholder values:
- `your-account-identifier`: e.g., `xy12345.us-east-1`
- `your-username`: Your Snowflake username
- `your-password`: Your Snowflake password

**Option B: Environment variables** (for CI/CD or temporary use)
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT="your-account-identifier"
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="your-username"
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD="your-password"
export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE="COMPUTE_WH"
export SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE="9R"
export SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA="FEE_EXPERIMENT"

# Or create a .env file in the project root (add to .gitignore!)
cat > .env << 'EOF'
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your-account-identifier
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your-username
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your-password
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=COMPUTE_WH
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=9R
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=FEE_EXPERIMENT
EOF
```

**Option C: Streamlit secrets** (for Streamlit Cloud deployment)
```bash
# Create .streamlit directory
mkdir -p .streamlit

# Create secrets file
cat > .streamlit/secrets.toml << 'EOF'
[snowflake]
account = "your-account-identifier"
user = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "9R"
schema = "FEE_EXPERIMENT"
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
EOF

# Secure the file
chmod 600 .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

⚠️ **Important**: Never commit credentials to git! The `.gitignore` already excludes these files.

#### 5. Verify Your Setup

Run the verification script to check everything is working:

```bash
python verify_setup.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Python 3.12.8
✅ pandas
✅ polars
✅ streamlit
✅ altair
✅ plotly
✅ snowflake-snowpark-python
✅ Snowflake connection module importable
✅ Snowflake connection working
🎉 Setup complete! Run: pdm run dashboard
```

If you see any ❌, follow the suggestions in the output.

#### 6. Run the Dashboard

```bash
# Launch the Streamlit dashboard
pdm run dashboard

# The dashboard will open automatically in your browser at:
# http://localhost:8501
```

**First-time tips:**
- Dashboard may take 10-30 seconds to load data from Snowflake
- Use the sidebar filters to explore different date ranges and fee tiers
- Download CSV exports using the download button

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Problem: `pdm: command not found`**
```bash
# Check if PDM is installed
which pdm

# If not found, try the full path
~/.local/bin/pdm --version

# Add to PATH permanently
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Problem: `pdm install` fails with SSL errors**
```bash
# Try with pip fallback
pdm install --no-isolation

# Or use system Python
pdm install --python $(which python3)
```

**Problem: Snowflake connection fails**
```bash
# Test connection manually
python -c "
from thorchain_fee_analysis.data.snowflake_conn import test_connection
result = test_connection()
print(f'Connection: {'✅ Working' if result else '❌ Failed'}')
"

# Check your credentials
cat ~/.snowflake/connections.toml

# Verify account identifier format (should be: account.region)
# Example: xy12345.us-east-1 NOT xy12345.snowflakecomputing.com
```

**Problem: Import errors when running scripts**
```bash
# Activate the PDM virtual environment
eval $(pdm venv activate)

# Or use pdm run for all commands
pdm run python your_script.py
```

**Problem: Dashboard won't start**
```bash
# Check if port 8501 is already in use
lsof -ti:8501

# Kill the process if needed
kill $(lsof -ti:8501)

# Or use a different port
pdm run streamlit run dashboards/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Phase 1 SQL Scripts

All SQL used to validate the Phase 1 deliverables now lives in `sql/`. The scripts retain their original numbering (`00`–`16`) to indicate execution order, and a dedicated [sql/README.md](sql/README.md) explains the purpose of each file. Run these statements against Snowflake to rebuild the views consumed by the dashboard.

## Data Sources

### Snowflake Database: `9R.FEE_EXPERIMENT`

The analysis uses the following views:

- **`V_WEEKLY_SUMMARY_FINAL`**: Weekly aggregated metrics by fee tier
- **`V_FEE_PERIODS_MANUAL`**: Manually defined experiment periods
- **`V_PERIOD_REVENUE_CI`**: Revenue confidence intervals
- **`V_SWAPS_EXPERIMENT_WINDOW`**: Individual swap-level data

For detailed schema documentation, see [`docs/SNOWFLAKE_SWAPKIT_SCHEMA.md`](docs/SNOWFLAKE_SWAPKIT_SCHEMA.md).

## Development

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests
pdm run test

# Run tests with coverage
pdm run test-cov

# Lint code
pdm run lint

# Format code
pdm run format

# Check formatting without changes
pdm run format-check

# Run dashboard
pdm run dashboard
```

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pdm run precommit-install
```

This will automatically run linting and formatting checks before each commit.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pdm run test

# Run specific test file
pdm run pytest tests/test_snowflake_conn.py

# Run with coverage report
pdm run test-cov
```

### Working with Notebooks

```bash
# Launch JupyterLab
pdm run notebook
```

**Note**: If you see a "No file system provider found" error when opening `.ipynb` files in Cursor:
1. Install the **Jupyter** extension in Cursor (search "Jupyter" in Extensions)
2. Or use JupyterLab instead: `pdm run notebook`

See `notebooks/README.md` for detailed notebook setup instructions.

### Code Style

This project uses:
- **Ruff**: For linting and formatting (replaces Black, isort, flake8)
- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Style**: Follow PEP 8 with modern Python idioms

The codebase is automatically formatted on commit via pre-commit hooks.

## Phase 1 Results

Phase 1 focused on data validation and infrastructure:

✅ **Achievements**:
- Validated fee period data accuracy (all periods within 1 bps tolerance)
- Built Snowflake data pipeline with multiple authentication methods
- Created interactive dashboard for Phase 1 metrics
- Established testing and CI/CD infrastructure

**Key Findings**:
- 100% of manual fee periods validated successfully
- Average realized fees within 1 basis point of intended fees
- Data quality suitable for statistical analysis

For detailed validation results, run the dashboard and navigate to the "Experiment Validation" section.
