curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
pdm --version
```
**Expected**: PDM version 2.x.x displayed

#### Step 2: Dependency Installation
```bash
cd /path/to/project
pdm install
```
**Expected**:
- `.venv/` directory created
- All packages installed without errors
- Takes 2-5 minutes

**Known Issues to Check**:
- SSL certificate errors
- Network timeouts
- Python version compatibility

#### Step 3: Pre-commit Setup
```bash
pdm run precommit-install
```
**Expected**:
- Git hooks installed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Message: "pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit"

#### Step 4: Verification Script
```bash
python verify_setup.py
```
**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Python 3.12.8
‚úÖ pandas
‚úÖ polars
‚úÖ streamlit
‚úÖ altair
‚úÖ plotly
‚úÖ snowflake-snowpark-python
‚úÖ Snowflake connection module importable
‚ö†Ô∏è  Snowflake connection not configured (optional)
```

### Snowflake Connection (NOT TESTED - Requires Credentials)

#### Option A: Connection File
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.snowflake
cat > ~/.snowflake/connections.toml << 'EOF'
[9R]
account = "test-account"
user = "test-user"
password = "test-password"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "9R"
schema = "FEE_EXPERIMENT"
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.snowflake/connections.toml
```
**Expected**: File created with correct permissions (600)

#### Test Connection
```python
from thorchain_fee_analysis.data.snowflake_conn import test_connection
result = test_connection()
print(f"Connection: {'‚úÖ Working' if result else '‚ùå Failed'}")
```
**Expected**: Either success or clear error message

### Dashboard Launch (NOT TESTED - Requires Dependencies)

```bash
pdm run dashboard
```
**Expected**:
- Streamlit starts on http://localhost:8501
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Snowflake connection works
- Data displays correctly
- Charts render properly
- Filters work as expected

### Test Suite (NOT TESTED - Requires Dependencies)

```bash
pdm run test
```
**Expected**:
- All tests pass
- No import errors
- Mock connections work
- Coverage report generated

```bash
pdm run test-cov
```
**Expected**:
- HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/`
- Coverage percentage displayed

### Code Quality Tools (NOT TESTED - Requires Dependencies)

```bash
pdm run lint
```
**Expected**: No linting errors or warnings

```bash
pdm run format
```
**Expected**: Code formatted consistently

```bash
pdm run precommit-run
```
**Expected**: All hooks pass

### Git Workflow (NOT TESTED - Requires Git Write)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify pre-commit hooks"
```
**Expected**:
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically
- Ruff formats code
- All checks pass
- Commit succeeds
